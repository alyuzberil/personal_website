## Abstract

This oral presentation discusses novel approaches to multi-frequency relaxation mapping using an arbitrary waveform Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) scanner developed during my Master's research at Bilkent University.

## Conference Details

**Conference:** Bilkent University EEE Graduate Research Conference  
**Date:** January 2023  
**Type:** Oral Presentation  
**Authors:** B. Alyuz, M. T. Arslan, M. Utkur, E. U. Saritas

## Key Contributions

- Arbitrary waveform MPI scanner design and implementation
- Multi-frequency relaxation mapping techniques
- Single-pass acquisition protocols
- Novel imaging capabilities for magnetic particle imaging
