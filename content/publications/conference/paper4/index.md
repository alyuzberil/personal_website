##### Abstract

In magnetic particle imaging (MPI) systems, impedance matching or tuning circuitry has to be employed at a particular operating frequency to handle the reactive power. In this work, we propose a drive coil design with a Rutherford cable winding that enables arbitrary waveform (AW) characteristics in an MPI scanner. The AW drive coil achieves a 144-fold reduction in inductance and 12-fold reduction in voltage to generate a given drive field (DF) amplitude. With imaging experiments, we show that the proposed design can enable imaging in a wide bandwidth, providing flexibility for different functional imaging applications of MPI.
