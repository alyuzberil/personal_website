##### Abstract

In Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), relaxation behavior of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) has enabled the inference of information about different MNP types and their local environments, such as viscosity and temperature. Previously, we have proposed and demonstrated an arbitrary waveform (AW) MPI scanner that facilitates operation in a wide range of drive field (DF) frequencies by eliminating the need for impedance matching. In this work, we propose a technique for simultaneous relaxation mapping at multiple DF frequencies in a single pass using an AW MPI scanner.
