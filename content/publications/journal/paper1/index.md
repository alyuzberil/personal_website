##### Abstract

This study investigates the antibacterial properties and osteoblast interactions of microfluidically synthesized chitosan-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) composite nanoparticles. The research demonstrates the potential of these composite nanoparticles for biomedical applications, particularly in bone tissue engineering and antimicrobial treatments.
